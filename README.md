# Utripn v1.0

# Created with create-react-app
# Download and
```npm install```
# Utripn is a single page react app that helps the user organize and track trips with images, blurbs, suggestions, and recaps much like a condensed journal.
* Create Journal logs from past trips that only you will see
* Create wishlists for future trips and put that song that explains your "why"
* Make a public forum checklist of items you took that you would recommend (everyone can see these)
* Go to the cookie jar to figure out how long it will take you to save for that trip
